# WLB Frontend Test Assignment

## Note

### GraphQL testing API

- The API is entirely static, it is not ephemeral. So while the
  mutation works as expected, the changes will not be reflected.

- There is no authentication within the API, the login page lets you identify
  as user ID 1-10 (see note above.)

## Setup

- [`pnpm`][pnpm-setup] is recommended.
- `pnpm install`

### Development

- `pnpm run dev`

### Build

- `pnpm run build`
- `pnpm run preview`
